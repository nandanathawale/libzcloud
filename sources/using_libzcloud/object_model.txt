*****
Model
*****

The following object-oriented model is the core of libzcloud. It is intended
to be independent of the language it is represented in, but some differences
should be expected.

None of the classes in the model should be instantiated themselves.
They should be subclassed, and that subclass instantiated.

.. class:: Store

   Stores represent a service that provides persistence of arbitrary blobs.
   An example is Amazon S3.

   .. method:: create(address, progress, error)

      Creates whatever is represented by the address.

      :param address: the address to create
      :type address: String
      :param progress: an optional :class:`ProgressListener`
      :param error: optional storage for an error
      :returns: true (on success) or false (on failure)
      :rtype: boolean

   .. method:: upload(address, producer, progress, error)

      Upload some data.  ``producer`` will be consulted for metadata
      (e.g. MD5 hash and size) and is responsible for actually reading the data
      to be uploaded. The :class:`Store` handles actually uploading the data
      to the storage service.

      :param address: the address to store the data at
      :type address: String
      :param producer: an :class:`UploadProducer`
      :param progress: an optional :class:`ProgressListener`
      :param error: optional storage for an error
      :returns: true (on success) or false (on failure)
      :rtype: boolean

   .. method:: download(address, consumer, progress, error)

      Download data from ``address``. The ``consumer`` is responsible for
      "doing something useful" with the data received from the storage service.
      For example, it could save it to a file.

      :param address: the address to fetch data from
      :type address: String
      :param consumer: a :class:`DownloadConsumer`
      :param progress: an optional :class:`ProgressListener`
      :param error: optional storage for an error
      :returns: true (on success) or false (on failure)
      :rtype: boolean

   .. method:: exists(address, progress, error)

      Checks if the given ``address`` exists

      :param address: the address to check
      :type address: String
      :param progress: an optional :class:`ProgressListener`
      :param error: optional storage for an error
      :returns: true (on success) or false (on failure)
      :rtype: boolean

   .. method:: delete(address, progress, error)

      Delete whatever is represented by ``address``

      :param address: the address to delete
      :type address: String
      :param progress: an optional :class:`ProgressListener`
      :param error: optional storage for an error
      :returns: true (on success) or false (on failure)
      :rtype: boolean

   .. method:: list(template, consumer, progress, error)

      List all addresses matching ``template``, calling
      List all :class:`addresses <Address>` matching ``template``, calling
      :meth:`ListConsumer.got_result` for each one. The ``template`` should
      just use ``%s`` as a placeholder and ``%%`` to represent ``%``.

      :param template: the template to list matches for
      :param consumer: a :class:`DownloadConsumer`
      :param progress: an optional :class:`ProgressListener`
      :param error: optional storage for an error
      :returns: true (on success) or false (on failure)
      :rtype: boolean

.. class:: ProgressListener

.. class:: UploadProducer

   .. method:: read(buffer, bytes, error)

      :param buffer: storage for the read bytes
             (large enough to hold the requested number of bytes)
      :param bytes: the requested number of bytes to read
      :param error: optional storage for an error
      :returns: the number of bytes actually read and copied into ``buffer``

   .. method:: reset(error)

      Reset the producer. The next call to :meth:`read <UploadProducer.read>` should return the
      same data as the first one.

      :param error: optional storage for an error
      :returns: true on success and false on error

   .. method:: get_size(error)

      :param error: storage for an error
      :returns: the number of bytes that this object will produce

   .. method:: calculate_md5(error)

      :param error: optional storage for an error
      :returns: the MD5 hash of the data that this object will produce, or
                null on error

.. class:: DownloadConsumer

   .. method:: write(buffer, bytes, error)

      :param buffer: storage containing the bytes that shuld be consumed
      :param bytes: the number of bytes available for consumption
      :param error: optional storage for an error
      :returns: the number of bytes actually read from ``buffer``

   .. method:: reset(error)

      Reset the consumer. All previous calls to :meth:`write <DownloadConsumer.write>` should be "forgotten"

      :param error: optional storage for an error
      :returns: true on success and false on error

.. class:: ListConsumer

   .. method:: got_result(address)

      :param address: an address
      :type address: String
