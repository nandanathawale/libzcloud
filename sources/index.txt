libzcloud
=========

Libzcloud is an abstraction for cloud storage services.  It provides an easy,
consistent interface to a variety of cloud services in the form of a system
library (``libzcloud``) and a command-line utility (:command:`zcloud`).

Note that this documentation is still essentially a series of notes we've added
as we've built parts of the library.  It needs serious thought put toward
proper organization and connection.
