.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBzcloud\fR \fBoperation\fR \fBstore-spec\fR \fB[key]\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBzcloud\fR provides command-line access to storage clouds via libzcloud.
.PP
At the moment, the entirety of its operation is to load a plugin based on
the given prefix and try to instantiate a \fIStore\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--plugin-path \fBpath\fR"
You can use this to set the path that libzcloud will search for plugins.
Overrides ZCPLUGINPATH.
.IP "--param \fBname\fR=\fBvalue\fR"
Set parameter \fBname\fR to \fBvalue\fR.
.IP "--append"
(\fBdownload\fR only) Append data to the end of the file, instead of clobbering
it. Requires that \fB--filename\fR be given too.
.IP "--filename \fBsome_file_name\fR"
(\fBupload\fR and \fBdownload\fR only) download to, or upload from,
\fBsome_file_name\fR.
.IP "--null"
(\fBlist\fR only) Print a NUL after each key.
.IP "--data \fBsome_string\fR"
(\fBupload\fR only) Upload \fBsome_string\fR, not including the terminating NUL.
.SH OPERATIONS
.IP "create"

.IP "exists"
Test to see if \fBkey\fR exists in the store.
.IP "delete"
Delete \fBkey\fR from the store.
.IP "upload"
Upload some data to \fBkey\fR in the store. Reads from stdin by default.
.IP "download"
Download data from \fBkey\fR in the store. Writes to stdout by default.
.IP "list"
List all keys in the store. If \fBkey\fR is supplied, it's used as a template
and only keys matching it are printed.
.SH EXIT STATUS
For most operations, \fBzcloud\fR returns 0 if the operation was successful and
1 if it was not. For the \fBexists\fR operation, 0 is returned if \fBkey\fR
exists and 2 is returned if it does not; 1 indicates an error, as usual.
